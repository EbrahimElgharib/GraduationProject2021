<p class="card-text">
    Science learning or science education is the teaching of science to non-scientists,
        such as school children, 
    college students, and also adults within the general public.
                </p>
<p>

    The science learning field can include work in science content, 
    science process (the scientific method), 
    social and citizen science, and some teaching pedagogy.
</p>

<p>

In the last decades, science learning was based on traditional teaching methods. But through the last few years, 
we have noticed a significant change due to the revolution of the “information age.” 
</p>    


<p>
Now we can see various applications for the internet and electronic devices in the world of science learning and teaching.
    Advances in computer and network technologies may facilitate and provide constructivist and cooperative learning environments,
    thus paving the way for cooperative activities and constructivist learning.
</p> 

<p>
Now let’s take a look at the main emergent technologies that are applied in science learning. 
Here you can find four effective technologies that have a breakthrough in science learning.  
</p> 

<h4 class="text-uppercase text-primary">
    1- Virtual labs, Simulations, and Dynamic Visualizations
</h4>
         

<p>
    Unlike computational thinking, the amount of research about using virtual labs and simulation in science learning is large.
     There are a large number of recent studies that discuss the efficiency of tools designed to simulate science labs,
     field trips, and scientific phenomena with relatively high fidelity.

</p>

<p>
    These studies include varied simulations that varied in terms of functionalities (i.e., simulation of a phenomenon,
     and virtual lab), disciplines (chemistry, biology, and life sciences), 
    and purpose for integration (i.e., assessment, teaching, or both). 
</p>

<p>
    There are 14 papers that have been published in the Journal of Research in Science learning which is the top journal in the field.
     These papers include 2 studies on video games, 
    10 on integrated simulations, and 2 on interactive dynamic visualizations. 
</p>

<p>

    The authors employed different types of simulations, games, and visualizations in these papers for assessment, 
    learning, and problem-solving. They used different metrics to measure the effectiveness of the tools used in these studies,
     and an overall benefit was observed for conditions where these tools were employed. 
</p>


<h4 class="text-uppercase text-primary">
    2- Technology of Online Science Learning
</h4>


<p>
    Online science courses are a virtual workplace that gives you advantages of time and place flexibility.
     As long as you meet your deadlines and communicate with your instructor and peers, 
    it doesn’t matter where or when you fulfill the requirements.
</p>


<p>



That’s besides taking into consideration that online study requires just as much work as an offline study. 
And the amount of time you dedicate is also about the same. However, 
the online format—just as a virtual workplace—makes you afford more flexibility.
 Often, you are required to do the same tasks every week (e.g., review the learning objectives,
  complete the assigned readings, go through the lecture materials, 
participate in the discussion boards, and submit assignments).

</p>


<p>

    Adjusting to an online learning model could be a challenge at first. But once you adapt to the format, 
    there are numerous benefits to be realized. No matter the reason you choose to pursue online education,
     earning an online degree can help prepare you for career advancement and demonstrate key skills to potential employers. 
</p>


<h4 class="text-uppercase text-primary">
    3- Flexibility 
</h4>

<p>
    Not many people have the ability to take time off from work to commit to a full-time graduate program,
    and others often travel for work. 
    For those who still need to juggle working and going back to school, 
    the flexibility of an online program provides individuals with the opportunity to 
    learn while still working and growing professionally.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, students don’t always feel comfortable asking professors to repeat 
    a point they made in their last lecture or dive into deeper detail on a specific topic. When learning online, 
    you can revisit past material or stop the lecture to perform additional research or organize your notes.
</p>


<h4 class="text-uppercase text-primary">
    4- Critical Thinking Skills
</h4>


<p>
    Online learning facilitates the ability to think critically about what you do every day. 
    The goal in the classroom is to challenge you to think differently, and employers want you to do that, 
    too–to think critically in your role at work. 
    Mastering this skill is what will set you apart as a student and as an employee.
</p>


<p>
    

Critical thinking plays a role in any type of education; however,
 online learning forces you to develop your critical thinking skills
  in ways that you might not have practiced in an in-person classroom setting.
 This sort of self-paced and self-motivated learning demonstrates to future employers 
 that you have the ability to think critically and overcome any obstacles that might stand in your way.
</p>

<h4 class="text-uppercase text-primary">
    5- Virtual Communication and Collaboration
</h4>

<p>


Learning to work with others in a virtual environment can make you a more effective leader. 
You’ll develop critical leadership skills by utilizing specialized knowledge, 
creating efficient processes, and making decisions about best communication practices, 
such as what should be discussed in-person or electronically. 
</p>

<p>

    In an online program, you’ll also participate in discussion boards with your classmates,
     communicate with professors via email, and collaborate through various software programs. 
     As the program progresses, you’ll get better at pitching your ideas and making strong, succinct,
     professional arguments through text.
