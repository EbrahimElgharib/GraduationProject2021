    Introduction
</h4>
         

<p>
    The emergence and development of modern physics was a giant leap in the history of mankind.
     This is because the main theories of modern physics reshaped our perception of the universe
      and caused an incredible scientific revolution.

    Modern physics is a branch of physics that includes the post-Newtonian concepts in the world of physics.
     It is based on the two major breakthroughs of the twentieth century: relativity and quantum theory. 
    
    The term modern physics means up-to-date physics. This term refers to the breakthrough that happened after Newton’s laws,
     Maxwell’s equations, and thermodynamics, these laws which are known as “classical” physics. 

</p>

<p>
    So modern physics can be considered the most recent step in the history of physics.
     This history has roots back to ancient Greece, old India, old china, the Islamic world,
      and medieval Europe. Then came the scientific revolution which is based on the ideas of Nicolaus Copernicus,
     Galileo Galilei, René Descartes, Isaac Newton, and others. 
</p>

<p>
    In this article, we are going to take a look at the history of physics in these ages and the evolution of the main
     theories of modern physics. Also, we will discuss some of the most popular principles of modern physics using 
    the practical experience that is provided by the modern physics virtual lab from PraxiLabs.

<p>

    This article will also include brief notes on the two major breakthroughs of modern physics in the early twentieth century: 
    relativity and quantum physics.
</p>


<h4 class="text-uppercase text-primary">
    Classical Physics And Before That
</h4>


<p>
    Physics is a branch of science whose primary objects of study are matter and energy. 
    And it is branching today to classical physics and modern physics. 
</p>


<p>

    But what about its history? How did physics start?
   <h4 class="text-uppercase text-primary">Physics of Ancient Greece:</h4> 

</p>


<p>

    Before the archaic period in Greece’s history, people were explaining every natural phenomenon by supernatural,
     religious, or mythological explanations.
     This was the prevailing mindset until it was changed by Thales of Miletus.
</p>


<p>
    Thales of Miletus was a Greek mathematician and astronomer who was called “the father of science,” 
    who first said that every event had a natural cause. And he suggested that the water is the building block of all matter.
     Then Anaximander argued Thales’s Theory and suggested that another substance called Apeiron is the basic element. 
</p>
<p>
    These philosophers were followed by others such as Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocles, Zeno of Elea, 
    and Democritus. They founded the Pre-Socratic philosophy, 
     an ancient Greek philosophy that existed before Socrates and was not influenced by him. 
</p>




<p>
    And one of the most important achievements of this period was the development of the theory of atomism that was first
    suggested by Leucippus and his student Democritus. They discussed the idea that all the universe matter is composed entirely of
     various imperishable,
     indivisible elements called atoms.
</p>


<p>
    
    In the classical period in Greece, a genius philosopher left his mark on history. He was called Aristotle, 
    the one who revealed the importance of observation and considered it the key to discovering the
     laws that control natural phenomena. 
</p>



<p>

    Aristotle wrote the first work which refers to that line of study as “Physics,” in the 4th century BCE.
     And he formed the theory of four elements and tried to explain the laws of motion and gravity. 
</p>

<p>

    After a long time  the great mathematician Archemids developed the principles of equilibrium states and the centers of gravity.
     These ideas would influence the great scholars: Galileo and Newton in the future
</p>


<h4 class="text-uppercase text-primary">Islamic World:


</h4> 

<p>

    In the middle ages in the Islamic world between the 7th and the 15th centuries, 
    a great scientific revolution was in action. 
</p>

<p>

    With the great translation movement of the greek and Indian scientists’ books into Arabic, 
    science became available to the Islamic geniuses to leave their marks on the scientific heritage of humankind. 
</p>


<p>

    One of the most important Arabic scholars in this period was Ibn al-Haytham. He made great contributions to scientific progress. 
    Ibn al-Haytham was considered “the father of the modern
     scientific method” due to his method that was based on the experimental data and reproducibility of its results. 
</p>



<p>

    In regards to physics, Ibn al-Haytham is “the father of optics.” 
    As he suggested that light travels to the eye in rays from different points on an object. 
</p>

<p>

    And there was another well-known genius called Ibn Sina, who contributed to science with his book “Book of Healing.”
     He discussed the theory of motion and he suggested that any projectile in a vacuum would not stop
      unless it is acted upon by opposite force, which is consistent with Newton’s 
      first law of motion inertia that states that an object in motion will stay in motion unless it is acted on by an external force. 
</p>

<p>

    Another Islamic scholar Abu’l-Barakat discussed the acceleration of a falling body as
     a result of its increasing impetus. And Ibn Bajjah who is known as “Avempace” in Europe explained that there is always
      a reaction force for any opposite force. But he did not note that these forces are equal. 
      This was a forerunner to Newton’s third law of motion which states
     that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
